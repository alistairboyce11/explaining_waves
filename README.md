Welcome to explaining_waves!

This is the github page for the explaining waves section of the Deep Earth Explorers Exhibition hosted at the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge (2020-2021). This exhibit was created through a collaborative effort between the Sedgwick Museum and the Global Seismology group, University of Cambridge.

In here you'll find all the python codes required to generate movies to learn about how seismic waves travel through the Earth and the codes that we used to operate our interactive RaspberryPi setup.

./pi-rfid/ contains the scripts to operate the RaspberryPi
./wavefront_movie/ contains the scripts to make the animated movies in python
./wavefront_movie_home_screen/ contains the background Earth image loaded into the movies
./wavefront_movie_images/ contains images used within the individual movies that describe our research.
./wavefront_movie_outputs/ empty directory used to save the output files fo the movie making procedure.
